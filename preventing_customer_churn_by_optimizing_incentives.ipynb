That notebook had been adapted from the [AWS blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/ai/predicting-customer-churn-with-amazon-machine-learning/) and [AWS notebook](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/introduction_to_applying_machine_learning/xgboost_customer_churn/xgboost_customer_churn.ipynb)._\n",

    "*This notebook also builds on the AWS blog [Gain customer insights using Amazon Aurora machine learning](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/gain-customer-insights-using-amazon-aurora-machine-learning/), which focused on integrating churn information into the customer service response process, offering selected customers an incentive.  For ease of experimentation, this notebook has been built to run stand-alone, but the methods developed here are intended for integration into the environment of the prior blog.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*In this version of the notebook, in addition to building the predictive model we explore the key question: How do we create an optimal incentive program that we (as the provider) think is most likely to reduce churn, with the minimum cost to us?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Losing customers is costly for any business.  Identifying unhappy customers early on gives the business a chance to offer them incentives to stay.  This notebook describes using machine learning (ML) for the automated identification of unhappy customers, also known as customer churn prediction. ML models rarely give perfect predictions though, so this notebook is also about how to incorporate the relative costs of prediction mistakes when determining the financial outcome of using ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use an example of churn that is familiar to all of us – leaving a mobile phone operator.  Seems like I can always find fault with my provider du jour! And if my provider knows that I’m thinking of leaving, it can offer timely incentives – I can always use a phone upgrade or perhaps have a new feature activated – and I might just stick around. Incentives are often much more cost effective than losing and reacquiring a customer.\n",

    "Mobile operators have historical records on which customers ultimately ended up churning and which continued using the service. We can use this historical information to construct an ML model of one mobile operator’s churn using a process called training. After training the model, we can pass the profile information of an arbitrary customer (the same profile information that we used to train the model) to the model, and have the model predict whether this customer is going to churn. Of course, we expect the model to make mistakes–after all, predicting the future is tricky business! But I’ll also show how to deal with prediction errors.\n",

    "\n",
    "First, we'll assign the true negatives the cost of \\\\$0. Our model essentially correctly identified a happy customer in this case, and we won’t offer them an incentive. An alternative is to assign the true negatives the actual value of the customer's spend, as this is the customer's contribution to our overall revenue. \n",
    "\n",
    "False negatives are the most problematic, because they incorrectly predict that a churning customer will stay. We lose the customer and will have to pay all the costs of acquiring a replacement customer, including foregone revenue, advertising costs, administrative costs, point of sale costs, and likely a phone hardware subsidy. A quick search on the Internet reveals that such costs typically run in the hundreds of dollars so, for the right now, let's assume $500. This is the cost we'll use for each false negative. Our marketing department should be able to give us a value to use here for the overhead, and we have the actual customer spend for each customer in our dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we'll give an incentive to customers that our model identifies as churning. At this point let's assume a one-time retention incentive in the amount of \\$50. This is the cost we'll apply to both true positive and false positive outcomes. In the case of false positives (the customer is happy, but the model mistakenly predicted churn), we will “waste” the concession. We probably could have spent those dollars more effectively, but it's possible we increased the loyalty of an already loyal customer, so that’s not so bad. We'll be revising this initial approach below.\n"

Also, above some threshold, we've already lost the customer's heart and mind, even if they haven't actually left yet. So the best target for our incentive is between those two thresholds - these are the customers we can convince to stay. \n",

Stochastic programming [1, 2] is an approach for modeling optimization problems that involve uncertainty. Whereas deterministic optimization problems are formulated with known parameters, real world problems almost invariably include parameters which are unknown at the time a decision should be made. An example would be the construction of an investment portfolio to maximize return. An efficient portfolio would be defined as the portfolio that maximizes the expected return for a given amount of risk (e.g. standard deviation), or the portfolio that minimizes the risk subject to a given expected return [3].\n",

    "Depending on the size of the total budget we allocate, we may occasionally find that we’re offering all customers a discount. This discount allocation problem reminds us of the water-filling algorithm in wireless communications [4,5], where the problem is of maximizing the mutual information between the input and the output of a channel composed of several subchannels (such as a frequency-selective channel, a time-varying channel, or a set of parallel subchannels arising from the use of multiple antennas at both sides of the link) with a global power constraint at the transmitter. More power is allocated to the channels with higher gains to maximize the sum of data rates or the capacity of all the channels. The solution to this class of the problems can be interpreted by a vivid description as pouring limited volume of water into a tank, the bottom of which has the stair levels determined by the inverse of the sub-channel gains. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately our problem does not have an intuitive explanation as for the water-filling problem. This is due to the fact that, because of the nature of the objective function, the system of equations and inequalities corresponding to the KKT conditions [6] does not admit a closed form solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal incentives calculated here are the result of an optimization routine designed to maximize an economic figure, which is the expected total profit. While this approach provides a principled way for Marketing teams to make systematic, quantitative and analytics-driven decisions, it is also important to recall that the objective function to be optimized is a proxy measure to the actual total profit. It goes without saying that we cannot compute the actual profit based on future decisions (e.g. this would paradoxically imply maximizing the actual return based on future values of the stocks). But we can explore new ideas using techniques such as the potential outcomes work [7], which could be leveraged to design strategies for back-testing of our solution.\n",

    "We’ve now taken another step towards preventing customer churn. We’ve built on the prior blog, where we integrated our customer data with our ML model to predict churn. We can now experiment with variations on this optimization equation, and see the effect of different campaign budgets or even different theories of how they should be modeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "To gather more data on effective incentives and customer behavior, we could also test several campaigns against different subsets of our customers. We can collect their responses – do they churn after being offered this incentive, or not? – and use that data in a future ML model to further refine the incentives offered. We can use this data to learn what kinds of incentives convince customers with different characteristics to stay, and then use that new function within this optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we’re empowering Marketing with the tools to make data-driven decisions that they can quickly turn into action. This approach can drive fast iterations on incentive programs, moving at the speed with which our customers make decisions. Over to you, Marketing!\n"
